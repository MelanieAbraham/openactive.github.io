Additionally, you can notify users about your plans to publish sessions openly, while offering the option to opt-out if they wish.

### A simple addition to your Terms and Conditions similar to the following:

> Publishing Sessions Openly
>
> Information about your session that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) will be published as open data for anyone to access, use and share, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License (cc-by) version 4. This gives your sessions more visibility by publishing them openly to apps and websites that will help you promote them, including but not limited to, those listed here. This will help more people find your sessions, and will not incur any additional cost to you. \[You may opt-out of this free service in your settings page.\]

### A simple opt-out checkbox visible in your application as below:

> Publish sessions openly
>
> Information about your sessions that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) is published for anyone to access, use and share. This helps more people find your sessions, by making them visible on other apps and websites such as the ones listed here. This does not incur any additional cost to you.

### A simple e-mail alert similar to the following:

> Publishing sessions openly
>
> We are now giving your sessions more visibility by publishing information about them that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) openly to apps and websites that will help you promote your sessions, such as the ones listed here. This will help more people find your sessions, and will not incur any additional cost to you. If you want to opt-out of this free service, go to your settings page.
