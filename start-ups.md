### The OpenActive Enterprise

OpenActive exists to transform the sport and physical sector, by harnessing open data to make details about where and when activities happen accessible to everyone. 

By opening up this data, we are supporting millions of people in overcoming everyday barriers to physical activity, and growing the sector by extending its reach and engagement.

Currently, access to the data that people need to help them get active is limited, and data quality is often inconsistent and confusing. These data problems hamper both people who want to discover and participate in activities, and also activity providers who want to attract more people to their services.

OpenActive member organisations and individuals are working openly together to bridge this data gap and benefit the whole sector.

<h2 class="sub-heading-two">Why</h2>
<div class="one">


### Innovating with data for a more active future

**The OpenActive Accelerator establishes ready-to-market startups using open data to develop digital products and services that help people get active.**

The Open Data Institute has already supported over 120 innovative data startups worldwide, from helping to create pioneering transport services, to transforming the retail and finance sectors. Now, the ODI is bringing new growth and wider impact to the sport and physical activity sector, using open data to make it easier than ever before for millions of people across the nation to get active.  

>“We’re supporting talented startups working with data who are determined to transform the way people discover and take part in physical activities. It’s hard for people to stay active, and it doesn’t have to be. Data will play a huge role in enabling innovation. We’re creating a place for innovators who can make it easier to find information, remove barriers that are stopping people from exercising regularly, and improve the journey of becoming and staying active.

>Together with our data expertise, network, and support, we can turn your ideas into marketable solutions, as we have achieved with over 120 startups worldwide.

>It’s going to be an exciting journey and we’d love to have you on board to catalyse positive change in the sport and physical activity sector. Let’s make it happen.”
